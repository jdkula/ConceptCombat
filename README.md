# ConceptCombat
Experimenting with implementing combat in Unity.

The idea was that the player must get out of the randomly generated area, and
can fight mosters randomly roaming the map on the way to the exit, in a turn-based battle system
inspired by Paper Mario. I may come back to this idea at some point...

This was basically my first real try at using Unity, and it definetly looks like it. I'm keeping
it around because I may want to come back to this idea at some point, but I'll probably end up
re-engineering it with my now-better understanding of Unity.

A few of the sound effects are from Undertale.
